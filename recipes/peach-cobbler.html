<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<h5><strong>Peach Filling:</strong></h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    4 pounds ripe yellow peaches (about 12 medium-sized peaches), peeled,
    pitted, and sliced into 1/2 inch thick wedges
  </li>
  <li>1 cup sugar, divided 2/3 cup and 1/3 cup</li>
  <li>
    1/2 cup instant tapioca (grind in a food processor for better texture)
  </li>
  <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
  <li>1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Cobbler Topping:</strong></h5>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
  <li>3/4 cup (6-ounces) butter, cut into 1/2 inch chunks</li>
  <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recipe:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Place the peaches, 2/3 cup of the sugar, instant tapioca, lemon juice, lemon
    zest, and vanilla in a large bowl and stir to evenly coat the peach slice
    with everything. <br />
    Let sit for 30 minutes for the peaches to macerate and the tapioca to
    soften, stirring occasionally.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li><strong> Preheat oven to 350°F </strong></li>
  <br />
  <li>
    In a separate bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, 1/3 cup of sugar,
    baking powder, and nutmeg. <br />
    Cut the butter into the flour with your fingers or a fork until the mixture
    has the texture of a coarse meal. Add the cream and stir with a fork until
    the dough mixture just comes together.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Butter a 2 1/2 to 3 quart casserole baking dish. Spread the sliced peaches
    out in an even layer. Crumble the dough mixture over the peaches.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Bake at 350°F until the peaches are bubbly and the topping is well browned,
    about 50-60 minutes
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Let cool 10 minutes before serving. Serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped
    cream.
  </li>
</ol>
